## TOPIC 3 - Structuring your workspace: Data Science & Data Engineering Perspectives

#### In preparation for this week:
* read/listen/watch as much as you can from the annotated materials below

---

A Data Science Shop must follow three general principles to be equipped for collaboration:

* **replicability**
* **portability**
* **scalability**

We'll discuss some principles - and tricks - that take your workflow to that level.

### Structuring the Data Science workspace

People have put thought into standardizing workflows in Data Science starting with what workspaces should look like. Two very useful templates for workspaces are [Cookiecutter for Data Science](http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) tailored for Python, and [ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.net/index.html) developed for R. They are a rich source of food for thought on what needs to be considered when building your workspace in a Data Science Shop.
